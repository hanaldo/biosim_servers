Running the BioSim Java server from commandline
===============================================
Make sure you have JDK 8 (Java) installed, and a fairly modern browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).

Open your terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows).

Make sure you are under the directory of ../jetty/. To easily do this, type the command “cd “ and drag the jetty folder into the prompt window after it.

After that the terminal will prompt you the sever is ready such as: "Thank you! You server is ready."

Open a browser and access the web app at your local IP address, followed by port “:8080” For example: "http://192.168.1.109:8080". You can access the web app at your public IP address from other computers. If you do not have any network connection, you can still always access the web app at "http://127.0.0.1:8080" or "http://localhost:8080".
