## Starting Position Server

## Setting up the area (dimension)
Before start to track tag positions, you need to specify width and the height of the tracked area, otherwise the indoor positions are meaningless. You can measure your area by hand if you have some long rulers, however our program can help you ease the process.

First, start the server program and go to the server live page, and then plug in the anchor 0 to your computer, and then start the serial port as prompted.

Right now you can power up a tag board (such as tag 0), and put your tag at the position of where you want your anchor 1 to be, so that the server can measure the distance between anchor 0 and anchor 1 (this may be your area width), after about 10 seconds or so when you think the distance is accurate (you kept the tag board steady), power off the tag board. And then setup the anchor 1 to the supposed position, after this use the same tag board to repeat the process again to measure your area height, i.e. put the tag at the position of where you want your anchor 2 to be.
